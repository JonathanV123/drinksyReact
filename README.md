# About
This app features user authentication utilizing JSON Web Tokens, a RESTful API connecting the React front-end with the Node and PostreSQL back-end. Redux is used to handle application state, and Material-UI was used to design the look and feel of application. This project taught me how Redux works, and how helpful it could be in larger projects. I also learned how to connect a React front-end with a Node back-end utilizing a RESTful API, and CORS.
